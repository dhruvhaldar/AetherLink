## 2024-10-24 - CLI Output Polish
**Learning:** Even in system-level languages like Ada, developers appreciate visual hierarchy and color. Adding a Hex Dump to packet simulations bridges the gap between high-level logic and low-level debugging, significantly improving DX.
**Action:** Look for opportunities to visualize invisible data (like bytes) in CLI tools.

## 2024-10-25 - Data Visualization Clarity
**Learning:** Raw hex dumps are mentally taxing to parse. Adding a synchronized ASCII view provides immediate context for text-based payloads without sacrificing the precision of the hex view.
**Action:** Always pair hex dumps with ASCII representations in CLI tools.

## 2024-10-26 - Visual Hierarchy in CLI
**Learning:** In dense data displays (like hex dumps), using distinct colors for metadata (offsets) vs. content reduces cognitive load and improves scannability.
**Action:** Use dimmed or distinct colors for line numbers, offsets, and separators in CLI output.
