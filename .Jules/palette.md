## 2024-10-24 - CLI Output Polish
**Learning:** Even in system-level languages like Ada, developers appreciate visual hierarchy and color. Adding a Hex Dump to packet simulations bridges the gap between high-level logic and low-level debugging, significantly improving DX.
**Action:** Look for opportunities to visualize invisible data (like bytes) in CLI tools.

## 2024-10-25 - Data Visualization Clarity
**Learning:** Raw hex dumps are mentally taxing to parse. Adding a synchronized ASCII view provides immediate context for text-based payloads without sacrificing the precision of the hex view.
**Action:** Always pair hex dumps with ASCII representations in CLI tools.

## 2024-10-26 - Visual Scanning Anchors
**Learning:** In verbose CLI outputs, emojis serve as powerful visual anchors (e.g., ✅, ❌, 📦) that allow users to scan status instantly without reading text. Combined with professional formatting (like hex offsets), this transforms a "log" into a "dashboard".
**Action:** Use emojis to denote state changes (success, failure, transmission) in CLI tools.
